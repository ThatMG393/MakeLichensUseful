# MakeLichensUseful

Makes glow lichens useful by making them a non spider climable block.

</center>

# Extras

You can make any block unclimable as long as the block has a tag `"minecraft:spider_unclimbable"`.

This makes it useful for other mods or even you to mark a block unclimable as long as this mod is installed.
